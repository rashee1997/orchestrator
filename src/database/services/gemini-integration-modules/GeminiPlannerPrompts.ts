- Specific Complexity Factors (list the reasons why this task is complex)
- Detailed Reasoning (explain your analysis)
- Recommended Action (HIGH_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS, MEDIUM_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS, LOW_COMPLEXITY_NO_SUBTASKS, or SKIP_COMPLETELY)

**Complexity Guidelines:**
- HIGH_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS (8-10): Multi-step, multi-system, requires detailed planning, parallel execution
- MEDIUM_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS (5-7): Several steps, some technical complexity, moderate planning needed
- LOW_COMPLEXITY_NO_SUBTASKS (1-4): Simple, straightforward, single-step tasks.
- SKIP_COMPLETELY: Administrative, trivial, or already too detailed.

**Special Instruction:** You MUST recommend \`HIGH_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS\` or \`MEDIUM_COMPLEXITY_SUBTASKS\` ONLY IF the task's title or description explicitly contains keywords indicating code-related work, such as "code changes", "implementation", "development", "bug fix", "refactoring", "unit tests", or "integration tests".

Task Generation Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
1. **Realistic Timeline**: Use conservative time estimates. Complex tasks should be 3-7 days minimum. Total project should be 2-4 weeks for typical implementations.
2. **TASK CLASSIFICATION**: Properly classify each task:
   - **implementation/refactoring/bugfix**: Set needs_code_generation=true, provide code_specification, set code_content="PENDING_CODE_GENERATION"
   - **testing**: Set needs_code_generation=false, provide test_specification, set code_content=null
   - **analysis/planning/review**: Set needs_code_generation=false, provide analysis_deliverables (e.g., ["Architecture Analysis Report", "Performance Assessment Document", "Risk Assessment Summary"]), set code_content=null
3. **Risk-First Approach**: Identify risks early and build mitigation strategies into the plan structure.
4. **Measurable Success**: Every task must have specific, quantitative completion criteria and KPIs.
5. **Comprehensive Dependencies**: Map out ALL interdependencies, including external systems, APIs, and resource constraints.
6. **Quality Gates**: Include explicit quality assurance tasks, code reviews, testing phases, and validation steps.
7. **Resource Planning**: Specify required skills, tools, and infrastructure for each task.
8. **Contingency Planning**: Include buffer time and alternative approaches for critical path tasks.

Code Content Rules (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS):
- **Implementation Tasks**: Complete specifications for code generation phase
- **Testing Tasks**: Detailed test specifications, NOT code generation
- **Analysis Tasks**: Clear deliverables and documentation requirements
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Placeholder code in any task type

Quality Requirements:
- Include unit tests and integration tests for all code
- Add performance monitoring and alerting
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Include comprehensive documentation and code comments
- Plan for scalability and maintainability

🚨 CRITICAL MANDATE: Task classification determines code generation approach. Implementation tasks get code specifications, testing tasks get test specifications, analysis tasks get deliverable specifications.

📝 REQUIRED DETAILS FOR ALL TASKS:
- **task_risks**: Must include 2-4 specific risks (e.g., "API rate limiting", "Memory consumption issues", "Integration complexity")
- **micro_steps**: Must include 3-6 detailed sub-steps (e.g., "1. Analyze current implementation", "2. Identify bottlenecks", "3. Design optimization strategy")
- **required_skills**: Must specify needed expertise (e.g., ["TypeScript", "Performance Optimization", "Database Design"])
- **analysis_deliverables**: For analysis tasks, must include specific deliverable documents (e.g., ["Code Review Report", "Performance Analysis", "Refactoring Recommendations"])
